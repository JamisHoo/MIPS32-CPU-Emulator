# MIPS32 CPU Emulator

This is a MIPS32 instruction subset based CPU emulator. It supports over 40 instructions and is capable of running a Unix-like OS [ucore](https://github.com/chyyuu/ucore_os_lab). This emulator is implemented in C++ and totally platform independent. You can compile it to JavaScript with [emscripten](http://emscripten.org) so as to run this emulator in web browsers.
